# Firesmartprototype
Fire smart is a system compromised of an app,  fire sensing device and a server that work hand in hand to solve a problem . The goal is to sense fire and it alerts the user when fire is sense . The user has the ability to stop the alarm through the app(if it’s false fire , for example smoke from cooking ) . The user has ability to instruct the app to call 911 to the house (incase the user isn’t home ) . If the user does not respond after a time limit set by the user . The alarm system automatically calls 911 .
